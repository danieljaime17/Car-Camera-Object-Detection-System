# Car-Camera-Object-Detection-System
This project aims to utilize computer vision and neural networks to analyze video recordings from multiple car cameras, enabling the identification and labeling of objects present in the footage.

Alright, so here's the deal. If I want to analyze the video recordings from all four cameras installed in my car and figure out what objects are in them, I'm going to need some fancy tools from the world of computer vision and neural networks. It's like teaching my computer to see and understand what's happening in those videos.

So, to get started, I'll use Python along with libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow. These are like my toolkit for working with images and neural networks.

Here's a basic plan of what I'll do:

First off, I'll break down each video into individual frames so I can analyze them one by one. Then comes the fun part – I'll use pre-trained models based on convolutional neural networks. These models are super smart and can recognize all sorts of objects in images.

Once I've got my model ready, I'll go through each frame of the video and use it to identify objects. This is where the magic happens! The model will give me a list of what it thinks is in each frame.

After I've got my list of objects, I can do some cleanup work to make sure everything looks nice and tidy. This might involve removing duplicate detections or filtering out things that the model isn't too sure about.

Finally, I'll visualize the results – basically, I'll draw boxes around the objects the model found and label them. This way, I can see exactly what's going on in each frame of the video.
